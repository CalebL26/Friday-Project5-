# Friday-Project5-
We know we have a database file classed "FridayProj5.db which we need to find the table name of. I first connected to the database itself then I ran a script to fetch the singular database table's name. After finding out the name "QuestAns" I extracted the data into a new file called quizbowl.py

I then build a quiz bowl game with the column names associated with the database. The user gets to input a answer to a question and see if he/she is right and then at the end of the game after the for loop is done iterating it will give the user a score based on how many questions he got correct. 

Finally, I staged all my stages and commited them to github
